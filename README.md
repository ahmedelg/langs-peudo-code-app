#### Pseudo supports many programming languages. so what's used to? the pseudo app used to eliminate the developing time. hmmm... So but How? before let me say as all of us know "the developers before codeing their great app, need to define the modules, classes, methods & many more... regardless of what are they going to build? it's like a discussion to map all componenets needed to be defined, integerated to build the whole app the developers need". So how the pseudo app can help these developers! pseudo app enables GUI thorugh it the developers can define their components, methods, modules & etc... and finally get the code to start over their app. Yes just that...
