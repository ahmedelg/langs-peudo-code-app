#####          Pseudo supports many programming languages. so what's used for? the pseudo app used for decreasing the coding time. hmmm... So but How? before let me say as all of us know "the developers before coding their awesome app, need to define the modules, classes, methods & many more... regardless of what are they going to build? it's like a discussion to map all components need to be defined, integrated with each other to form the whole app". So how the pseudo app can help those developers! pseudo app enables GUI, the developers can define the components, methods, modules & etc... and finally getting the code, and start building the app. yes just that...
